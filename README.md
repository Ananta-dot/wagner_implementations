# Cross-Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Geometry

## Code accompanying the capstone report "Cross-Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Geometry" as described in:

### Ananta Manoranjan, Cross-Entropy Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Geometry, NYU Abu Dhabi Seminar (Spring 2025).
### arXiv:2104.14516 – Adam Z. Wagner’s Deep CEM framework applied verbatim to geometric tasks.




All the necessary codes are in the format 'run_file.py' for each task under their respective directories.

## How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ananta-dot/wagner_implementations.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd [respective task directory]
python3 [respective run_file.py]
```
